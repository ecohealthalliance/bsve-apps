        "Description": "Credit Wikipedia    #10,387    Although bird flu  has captured most of our attention over the past year, scientists are abundantly aware of the potential for seeing novel swine-origin influenza viruses emerge as well.     Just last week in Live Markets & Novel Flu Risks In The United States, we looked at some of the zoonotic exposure risks and two weeks ago in Novel (H3N2v) Flu Case Reported In Minnesota, we saw the latest reported human infection with a swine-variant virus.    Swine are considered excellent `mixing vessels for influenza, as they are susceptible to a wide variety (swine, human, avian) of flu strains, they may be co-infected by more than one virus at a time, and they not only have ample contact with other pigs, but with humans as well.     Since pigs can be infected by more than one flu virus at the same time, it is possible for two viruses to swap genetic material (reassort), resulting in a new hybrid strain.     The 2009 H1N1 pandemic evolved from numerous reassortments in swine over a period of years, finally jumping species when it had become well enough adapted to human physiology.     Here in North America weve been watching the evolution of several swine variant viruses (H1N1v, H1N2v, H3N2v) over the past few years, all of which have reassorted with - and picked up the M gene segment from  the 2009 H1N1 virus (see Keeping Our Eyes On The Prize Pig).     All of which serves as prelude to a new study, and an accompanying editorial, published today in the Journal of Infectious Diseases that looks at the ongoing evolution of swine origin influenza viruses and the threats they pose to human health.     First the abstract (slightly reformatted for readability) to the study (a preliminary PDF version of the whole study is available).

        "Content": "Credit Wikipedia    #10,387    Although bird flu  has captured most of our attention over the past year, scientists are abundantly aware of the potential for seeing novel swine-origin influenza viruses emerge as well.     Just last week in Live Markets & Novel Flu Risks In The United States, we looked at some of the zoonotic exposure risks and two weeks ago in Novel (H3N2v) Flu Case Reported In Minnesota, we saw the latest reported human infection with a swine-variant virus.    Swine are considered excellent `mixing vessels for influenza, as they are susceptible to a wide variety (swine, human, avian) of flu strains, they may be co-infected by more than one virus at a time, and they not only have ample contact with other pigs, but with humans as well.     Since pigs can be infected by more than one flu virus at the same time, it is possible for two viruses to swap genetic material (reassort), resulting in a new hybrid strain.     The 2009 H1N1 pandemic evolved from numerous reassortments in swine over a period of years, finally jumping species when it had become well enough adapted to human physiology.     Here in North America weve been watching the evolution of several swine variant viruses (H1N1v, H1N2v, H3N2v) over the past few years, all of which have reassorted with - and picked up the M gene segment from  the 2009 H1N1 virus (see Keeping Our Eyes On The Prize Pig).     All of which serves as prelude to a new study, and an accompanying editorial, published today in the Journal of Infectious Diseases that looks at the ongoing evolution of swine origin influenza viruses and the threats they pose to human health.     First the abstract (slightly reformatted for readability) to the study (a preliminary PDF version of the whole study is available).
